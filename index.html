  Who is a kid?
</h2>
<p>
  The meaning of a <b>kid</b> is a young person especially child often used as a generalized reference to one especially younger or less experienced. kids are innocent, they love having fun most of the time.
</p>
<p>They learn faster and easier especially through play method. I know of a child that has learnt so many things through this. Anytime he comes back from school and you ask him what were you taught today in school, he says we were not taught anything today, we only played and play and play. But when you ask him okay what kind of play did you play in school, tell me about it, when he starts explaining and describing the play to you, you as an adult gets to known that he was taught alot of things, how sweet. i love kids so much.</p>
